  High-performance and field-hardened autonomy for mobile robotic systems.
</p>

We are a research group in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mae.ucla.edu) at UCLA that specializes in designing autonomy algorithms with formal performance guarantees for mobile robotic systems. Much of our work is vehicle agnostic but we have a strong focus on addressing the unique challenges encountered in aerospace systems. We utilize dynamical systems and control theory, optimization, and machine learning to design and verify algorithms that maintain consistent performance across diverse operating domains. Our work is improving the reliability and trustworthiness of autonomous systems that someday will be utilized in space, planetary exploration, emergency response, firefighting, and urban air transport. In addition to rigorous theoretical analysis, our work undergoes extensive field testing on our custom aerial robotic platforms.

Specific research areas of interests are:
<ul>
  <li>Nonlinear and optimal control</li>  
  <li>Localization and mapping</li>
  <li>Trajectory planning and optimization</li>
  <li>Multi-agent systems</li>
  <li>Advanced GNC for aerospace systems</li>
  <li>Decision making under uncertainty</li>
</ul>
