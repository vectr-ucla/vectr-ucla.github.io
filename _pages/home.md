  Pushing the boundaries of human knowledge in control theory and robotics
</p>

The VECTR Lab at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, UCLA, under the guidance of Dr. Brett Lopez, performs research in fields such as:
<ul>
  <li>optimal control and model-predictive control</li>
  <li>perception and learning for robotic navigation</li>
  <li>trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance</li>
  <li>multi-robot systems and multi-agent interaction in outer space</li>
</ul>
