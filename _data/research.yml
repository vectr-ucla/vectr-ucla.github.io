- title: "Multi-Agent Interaction with Tumbling Objects in Orbit"
  image: research/mas_space.jpg
  description: "This research explores techniques for the interaction of multiple chaser spacecraft with uncontrollable (and, often, limitedly observable) tumbling objects in orbit. This includes the implementation of model predictive control for trajectory tracking and planning, improvized task allocation algorithms, and the application of orbital dynamics in the target-centered coordinate frame."
